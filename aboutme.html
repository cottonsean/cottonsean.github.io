 I grew up as a lanky kid born in Chicago, and growing up in Meridian, Mississippi. I have the benefit of both Midwestern and Southern roots, and a minority perspective. Those culturally rich perspectives have become the backdrop for me and my identifying with the common person through political and social commentary.

Before and after college, I served my country in the Army for ten years. My military career deepened my resolve to stay connected to my country and community through civic involvement. Through writing, I hope to touch those around me and leave my footprint on the world.
